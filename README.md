# Data Animation

### Visualisation Overview
To study the performance of different car models over time. The performance in this context are based on the horsepower and fuel efficiency of each models. The visualisation of the graph are then extended into an animation that updated the model of cars based on their respective manufacturing years. 

### Dominated versus Non-dominated
In this project, we consider the domination of better model of cars. As such we intend to highlight the model of cars that perform better in both studied aspects. In order to differentiate these models from others, we transformed the colour of their respective plots in the animation while updating the shaded dominating region throughout the animation.
